            <strong>Getting formal formalities</strong> aside, my name is Aaron Chien, I graduated from UCLA 
            with a major in business economics and a minor in data science engineering. My SSN 
            and bank information is probably none of your business but I am 
            interested in data analytics, data science, econometrics, software engineering, and 
            machine learning/AI. After I finish my studies, I hope to enrich my academic journey 
            by going to grad school and earn my MBA/MCS after a year of working as an analyst. 
            Relevant courses I have taken are:

            <strong>My coding journey</strong> actually began my second year of college. During this time, I was 
            unsure about what I wanted to do. Trying to expand my interests and skill,
            I decided to go for a stats minor and took Stats 20, which was coding 
            in R studio. Although a struggle, I found it to be fun and it additionally benefitted 
            me with my economic courses that used R studio for their programming assignments. I did 
            more research into data science and analytics and thought that it would be a natural 
            transition to go into data science with my background in economics. During the summer, 
            I utilized all the skills I learned from economics and statistics and completed 
            different analysis projects as well as self-teaching myself python and SQL through YouTube 
            tutorials. As I researched more into data science, I saw that a lot of computer science 
            majors also were aligned with that subject and I started learning more about computer 
            science and spoke to a few friends about the different career options that studying 
            computer science offered. Interested, I changed my minor into the data science 
            engineering minor due to the courses offering more computer science related courses 
            rather than just pure statistical theory. My first taste of OOP was in C++ and 
            admittedly, it was a bigger struggle than R Studio, but I am thankful for the learning 
            opportunity it gave me and the chance to self-reflect about computer science. Although I 
            am still on the fence, I do idealize obtaining a master's in some study such as computer science, business, or finance.

            <strong>Beyond my academics and projects</strong>, I like to express my creative side and stay active 
            within my community! I previously acted as the internal director of relations for 
            Foundations Choregraphy at UCLA, where I help the organization manage 300+ members! I 
            generally ensure that we have our quarterly events happen by managing media and finance 
            but there is so much more that goes into that. With every position, work or 
            extracurricular related, you decided how much worth and work should be placed inside. 
            Thankfully, I am super passionate about the community and organization so I ensure to put 
            in my best effort. Foundations Choregraphy is actually where I started my dance journey 
            and through various workshops (classes) and teams, I learned that I am drawn to more 
            softer and slower beats and types of dancing. Dance styles I enjoy are tutting, popping, tracing, 
            floorwork, isolations, and footwork (pas de bourree, kick-ball chain). Photography is also 
            another creative art I pratice in (amatuerly I admit) as photos are captured memories 
            to me and when I’m old and just reminiscing on the past, I can look at these photos 
            and remember the good times. If curious, my dance and photography account is on my 
            insta: <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/miscellaaroneous/" target = "_blank" class = "aaron_insta";>@miscellaaaroneous</a>. If your’re still not impressed by my hobbies, I also like 
            cafe-hopping and exploring coffee/boba shops cause studying in different environments, 
            especially with caffeine and aesthetic lighting hits so hard so take me on a coffee/boba 
            chat sometime!

            As the Director of Analytics for the Community Service Commission, I led the evaluation of two key events: 
            Servocacy-Fest and Volunteer Day. For Servocacy-Fest, I analyzed public reach and engagement through social 
            media, attendance metrics, and word-of-mouth, assessing personal experiences and impacts using Excel to calculate 
            averages, medians, and modes. For Volunteer Day, I evaluated effectiveness, support received, and participant 
            satisfaction by grouping data by site and overall metrics. I utilized a decision tree classifier, achieving 84% 
            accuracy, to predict participant satisfaction and likelihood of return. This involved training a model with 70% 
            of the data, testing it with the remaining 30%, and visualizing the decision tree to provide actionable insights.

            My website! This project lasted over several months as I was trying to balance summer 
            school and self-learning javascript and HTML/CSS. After my 12 weeks of summer school, I 
            was able to grind on this and achieve this website within 2 weeks! I specifically wanted 
            to highlight the Javascript code as I used two dictionary data structures, JSON, and 
            document.querySelector to make the game work and keep scores as well as restarting it. 
            Instead of linking to this website, I’ll link it to my Github with the Javascript code.

            In the 13th annual Datafest competition, I analyzed American Law data to evaluate attorney response patterns 
            on a legal advice forum. My analysis revealed that attorneys typically spent less than an hour responding to 
            questions, with an average response time of around 26% of an hour, and that 32% of questions remained 
            unanswered on average across states. I used Python to group data by state, identifying common question 
            subcategories and categories, and analyzed attorney response times by year and month. To enhance data 
            visualization, I utilized Tableau to create hex maps, which provided a clear geographic representation of 
            response patterns and regional differences. This combination of analytical and visualization techniques 
            enabled me to deliver insightful findings on attorney engagement and question trends.

            In this SQL challenge, I navigated through a complex web of data involving 7 tables, each with its own primary and 
            foreign keys. My task was to find the mastermind behind a fictional murder in an intricate mystery. I employed 
            various SQL functions to pinpoint the culprit. Initially, I used SELECT statements to retrieve crucial data from 
            tables like crime_scene_report, person, interview, and drivers_license. Specifically, I leveraged subqueries within 
            WHERE clauses to correlate witnesses, vehicle details, and gym memberships. The LIKE operator helped in filtering 
            results based on partial matches, such as identifying the car plate number and gym membership. After piecing together 
            information about witnesses and suspects, I determined that Miranda Priestly was the mastermind. The process required 
            intricate joins and filtering to connect the dots from various clues.

            This is all my work for the Kaggle Housing competition - "House Prices - Advanced 
            Regression Techniques" where I used python as my choice of coding language in order to 
            predict housing prices. The project focused on predicting housing prices using a log-linear model, chosen based on 
            visual analysis that indicated a logarithmic relationship between housing features and prices. The dataset included 
            attributes such as dwelling type, zoning, lot size, street and alley type, utilities, and various property 
            characteristics. The methodology involved categorizing these attributes into groups like garages, location, 
            and condition, and then analyzing their significance. The model was developed with the formula: np.log(SalePrice) ~ 
            GarageCars + OverallQual/Age + BsmtFinSF1 + BsmtQual + FirFlrSF*GrLivArea + KitchenAbvGr*KitchenQual + CentralAir + 
            Fireplaces, incorporating both main effects and interaction terms. Despite this detailed approach, the model resulted 
            in an error metric of 0.15325, with a target of achieving a closer-to-zero value for improved prediction accuracy.

            In this project, accidents, I do statistical analysis on data from different industrial 
            safety and health issues as an introduction to doing data analysis in python. The data 
            was uploaded by "IHM STEFANINI" in 2017 which consists of accident records throughout 
            different plants in three different countries. In this project, I explored different 
            factors that contribute to the overall danger level and created a linear regression base 
            on these factors to determine accident levels. Relevant skills are for-loops in python, 
            violin plots, linear regression, and kernel density plots.

            This is my first project in python so my main focus with this is to get comfortable 
            with using python and doing data analysis. The data is fiction and was given after I 
            had completed Google's coursera on data analytics and earning my certificate online. 
            Relevant skills include creating functions in python, bar graphs and data visualization, 
            and statistical information including mean, count, and groupby.

            This is my first project in R studio. After my first year working as the finance chair 
            for Foundations Choreography at UCLA, I took the financial data (venmo) and uploaded 
            the dataset onto R studio to analyze fundraisers, profits, loss, and what gave us the 
            most amount of money in order to determine what should we shift our focus on. Relevant 
            skills included ggplot graphing and visualizations (pie graphs), regression lines, 
            profit margin, and a basic summary table (sum, percentage growth).

            This is my final paper on applied economics and theory. In this course, I used time 
            series data to observe how the federal interest rate impacts inflation, and whether or 
            not there is an actual significant correlation in 2023 after the recovery from COVID. 
            This question came up as in 2023, we were dealing with high inflation rates after 
            recovery from covid. It is theorized that the inflation was caused by an over-charge of 
            financial aid to people affected by COVID.

            This is my 3rd project for my course, Data Science for Economists. In this project, I 
            worked with 3 other members to analyze panel data. We took political data and tried to 
            predict whether or not these candidates would respond to their emails based on the 
            characteristics of the email itself and the characteristics of the sender. 
            Characteristics we analyzed were party, race, origin of region, and whether or not the 
            sender was a senator. We also took data from the states in order to see how cigar 
            prices in relation to other states affect prices. In addition, we also analyzed the 
            inflation, price, minimum price in other states, population, and sales. Concepts used 
            here were the pool model, fixed effects model, random effects model, linear probability 
            model, probit model, and logit model.

            This is my 2nd project for the course, Data Science for Economists. In this project, I 
            worked with 3 other members to observe time-series data. We took time-series data from 
            Kaggle and observed the climate change in Delhi, India. We analyzed the data and 
            performed Dickey-Fuller tests to see if the data was stationary and if not, we took the 
            differences until it was proven to be stationary. Concepts used here were ACF/PACF 
            plotting, AR modeling, ARDL modeling as well as MA and VAR. In general, this project was 
            a complex dataset involving statistical analysis and using time-series to predict the 
            weather and climate in India.

            This is my 1st project for my course, Data Science for Economists. In this project, I 
            took a dataset on world happiness and determined what variables are the most 
            significant in the happiness of citizens. This involved data cleaning, ggplots, and 
            data analysis. Concepts used here were Mallows CP to determine the most significant 
            variables, Boruta Algorithmn to determine interactions, RESET test, testing for 
            multicollinearity using VIF, BIC/AIC test, and cross-validation for testing. In total, 
            we wanted to determine which variables contributed to happiness but still wanted to 
            avoid consequences so these tests determine if the variables were actually contributing 
            to happiness or if it was suffering from collinearity with another variable, or if the 
            variance of the residuals demonstrated that it was not explained by the significant 
            variables we choose.

          Hi there! I hope you had a wonderful time browsing and my website provided no difficulties at 
          all. To thank you for being such a wonderful guest, I have one last surprise…I would like you 
          to try out being a barista! It’s very simple, you choose a type of caffeine between matcha, 
          espresso or tea, add in your base such as milk or water, and any toppings if the customer 
          wishes to add. A few more rules is that if you mess up, that’s okay you have to option to 
          replace the drink but that costs us money so please try to not mess things up. In addition, 
          you need at least a caffeine and a base to serve to the customer. And the customer gets what 
          they pay for, so make sure you are super careful when making the drinks. A few final tips: 
        </p>
          <p class = "bullet_container"> &#8226; tea is just caffeine + water </p>
          <p class = "bullet_container"> &#8226; americano is espresso + water </p>
