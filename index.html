            <strong>Getting formal formalities</strong> aside, my name is Aaron Chien, I currently go to UCLA 
            majoring in business economics and minoring in data science engineering. My SSN 
            and bank information is probably none of your business but I am 
            interested in data analytics, data science, econometrics, software engineering, and 
            machine learning/AI. After I finish my studies, I hope to enrich my academic journey 
            by going to grad school and earn my MBA/MCS after a year of working as an analyst. 
            Relevant courses I have taken are:

            <strong>My coding journey</strong> actually began my second year of college. During this time, I was 
            aiming to be an accountant due to the stability and eaisness I thought it would provide, 
            I have long grown out of this idea. However, I despised my accounting courses so in a 
            desperate move, I decided to go for a stats minor and took Stats 20, which was coding 
            in R studio. Although a struggle, I found it to be fun and it additionally benefitted 
            me with my economic courses that used R studio for their programming assignments. I did 
            more research into data science and analytics and thought that it would be a natural 
            transition to go into data science with my background in economics. During the summer, 
            I utilized all the skills I learned from economics and statistics and completed 
            different analysis projects as well as self-teaching myself python and SQL through YouTube 
            tutorials. As I researched more into data science, I saw that a lot of computer science 
            majors also were aligned with that subject and I started learning more about computer 
            science and spoke to a few friends about the different career options that studying 
            computer science offered. Interested, I changed my minor into the data science 
            engineering minor due to the courses offering more computer science related courses 
            rather than just pure statistical theory. My first taste of OOP was in C++ and 
            admittedly, it was a bigger struggle than R Studio, but I am thankful for the learning 
            opportunity it gave me and the chance to self-reflect about computer science. Although I 
            am still on the fence, I do idealize obtaining a master’s in computer science and 
            learning more about advance machine learning.

            <strong>Beyond my academics and projects</strong>, I like to express my creative side and stay active 
            within my community! I am currently acting as the internal director of relations for 
            Foundations Choregraphy at UCLA, where I help the organization manage 300+ members! I 
            generally ensure that we have our quarterly events happen by managing media and finance 
            but there is so much more that goes into that. With every position, work or 
            extracurricular related, you decided how much worth and work should be placed inside. 
            Thankfully, I am super passionate about the community and organization so I ensure to put 
            in my best effort. Foundations Choregraphy is actually where I started my dance journey 
            and through various workshops (classes) and teams, I learned that I am drawn to more 
            “chill” or “up-beat” types of dancing. Dance styles I enjoy are tutting, tracing, 
            floorwork, isolations, and footwork (pas de bourree, kick-ball chain). Photography is also 
            another creative art I pratice in (amatuerly I admit) as photos are captured memories 
            to me and when I’m old and just reminiscing on the past, I can look at these photos 
            and remember the good times. If curious, my dance and photography account is on my 
            insta: <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/miscellaaroneous/" target = "_blank" class = "aaron_insta";>@miscellaaaroneous</a>. If your’re still not impressed by my hobbies, I also like 
            cafe-hopping and exploring coffee/boba shops cause studying in different environments, 
            especially with caffeine and aesthetic lighting hits so hard so take me on a coffee/boba 
            chat sometime!

            Personal Project competed in UCLA’s 2023 13th annual Datafest competition, a 48 hour 
            data science hackathon where a real company with a problem would provide a complex 
            dataset for teams to work with and analyze, delivering results by the final day of the 
            competition. Related skills are python programming, statistical analysis (mean, min, 
            max), data cleaning (removing Na, missing values, removing outliers), and tableau 
            (creating hex maps with color-coordinated states and legends)

            This is all my work for the Kaggle Housing competition - "House Prices - Advanced 
            Regression Techniques" where I used python as my choice of coding language in order to 
            predict housing prices. I received a final score of 0.15235, in which the highest 
            possible is 0. In this competition, I evaluated more than 10 variables and tested 
            different models in order to come up with the most accurate model to predict housing 
            prices. I am proud of the work I did for this competition and would love to dive into 
            more machine learning and data science projects to further explore the possibilities 
            of code. Relevant skills include data visualization (line graphs and violin parts to 
            observe distributions and trends), creating custom functions, regression models 
            (log-linear), and hypothesis testing (testing the significance of variables and interactions).

            In this project, accidents, I do statistical analysis on data from different industrial 
            safety and health issues as an introduction to doing data analysis in python. The data 
            was uploaded by "IHM STEFANINI" in 2017 which consists of accident records throughout 
            different plants in three different countries. In this project, I explored different 
            factors that contribute to the overall danger level and created a linear regression base 
            on these factors to determine accident levels. Relevant skills are for-loops in python, 
            violin plots, linear regression, and kernel density plots.

            This is my first project in python so my main focus with this is to get comfortable 
            with using python and doing data analysis. The data is fiction and was given after I 
            had completed Google's coursera on data analytics and earning my certificate online. 
            Relevant skills include creating functions in python, bar graphs and data visualization,

            Hello, in this project done in R studio, I take three stocks and analyze their behavior 
            in order to try to forecast future values and investments using time series. Relevant

            This is my first project in R studio. After my first year working as the finance chair 
            for Foundations Choreography at UCLA, I took the financial data (venmo) and uploaded 
            the dataset onto R studio to analyze fundraisers, profits, loss, and what gave us the 
            most amount of money in order to determine what should we shift our focus on. Relevant 
            skills included ggplot graphing and visualizations (pie graphs), regression lines, 
            profit margin, and a basic summary table (sum, percentage growth).

            This is my final paper on applied economics and theory. In this course, I used time 
            series data to observe how the federal interest rate impacts inflation, and whether or 
            not there is an actual significant correlation in 2023 after the recovery from COVID. 
            This question came up as in 2023, we were dealing with high inflation rates after 
            recovery from covid. It is theorized that the inflation was caused by an over-charge of 
            financial aid to people affected by COVID.

            data analysis. Concepts used here were Mallows CP to determine the most significant 
            variables, Boruta Algorithmn to determine interactions, RESET test, testing for 
            multicollinearity using VIF, BIC/AIC test, and cross-validation for testing. In total, 
            we wanted to determine which variables contributed to happiness but still wanted to 
            avoid consequences so these tests determine if the variables were actually contributing 
            to happiness or if it was suffering from collinearity with another variable, or if the 
            variance of the residuals demonstrated that it was not explained by the significant 
            variables we choose.
